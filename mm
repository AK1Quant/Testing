Topic: Model Selection and Stress Testing

Attendees: [List of attendees]

Date: [Date]

Summary:

The meeting discussed the selection of a champion model for revenue forecasting and stress testing. After reviewing various options, the Model 1 Nominal GDP with Q1 dummy and INT dummy was finalized as the champion model. This decision aligns with business expectations, as the strengthening of the Swiss Franc is anticipated to increase revenue from foreign transactions.

Business Context:

The business operates two classes: Retail and Affluent. The Retail class generates revenue primarily from debit card transactions abroad, while the Affluent class earns revenue from investments abroad, albeit to a lesser extent.

Model Selection Rationale:

The Nominal GDP model is aligned with business expectations, as it captures the impact of foreign transactions on revenue.

Stress Testing:

For the FPM and Net Transaction Fees models, a two-standard deviation stress test will be applied, reflecting the empirical behavior of the data. These models will be treated as separate entities, and the business has suggested developing distinct models for each.

Action Items:

- Implement the champion model for revenue forecasting
- Conduct stress testing using the FPM and Net Transaction Fees models
- Develop separate models for each business class, as suggested by the business
