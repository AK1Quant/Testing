I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to update you on the status of my provisional certificate/degree certificate request. I had received an email from FADV regarding this, and I replied that I have applied for it from my college, but it is still in progress.

In the meantime, I offered to send a provisional grade history certificate, which includes all courses and credits, as an alternative. However, I haven't received a response yet. I wanted to check with you if it would be acceptable to send the provisional grade history certificate to you, and if so, would you like me to proceed with sending it?

Please let me know your guidance on this matter.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
