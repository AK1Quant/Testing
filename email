Subject: Upcoming Material Model Change Submission - Request for Guidance

Dear [Model Validator's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. We are planning to file a material model change in the model, driven by the integration of the US and CS combined models. To ensure a smooth validation process, we would like to request your guidance on the following:

1. Supporting documents: Could you please specify the necessary supporting documents required for the submission?
2. Critical components: What are the essential elements that need to be included in the model documentation and analysis files?
3. Key considerations: Are there any specific aspects we should focus on while preparing the submission to facilitate a seamless validation process?

Additionally, we would appreciate an estimate of the timeline for model validation after our submission. This will help us plan accordingly.

Thank you in advance for your guidance and support. We look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
