I hope this message finds you well. I have a few questions regarding my PF details in the pay slip:

- Why is my PF Number not mentioned in the pay slip?
- Is my PF account active and open?
- Why are my PF Number and UAN Number not displayed in the pay slip?
- Could you please guide me on where I can view the PF amount deducted and contributed to my account?

I would appreciate it if you could clarify these points and assist me in understanding my PF details.
