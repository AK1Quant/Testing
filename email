Hi Danajay,

Hope you're doing well. We need a bit of your assistance with some baseline calculations. We're experiencing a discrepancy between the NNm flow numbers and the Y1 NNm values - they don't seem to match.

Could you please help us identify the issue and resolve the mismatch? Your expertise would be greatly appreciated in getting our calculations aligned.

Specifically, we'd like to know:

- Where the NNm flow numbers are coming from
- How they're being calculated
- Why they don't match the Y1 NNm values

Your prompt assistance will help us move forward with our project. Please let us know if you're available to discuss further.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
