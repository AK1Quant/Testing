You’re right; simply adding the forecasts from LSTM and GARCH might not be effective for combining them due to different scales and meanings of the predictions. A better approach can be to use the GARCH model to estimate the volatility and then use this volatility estimate to adjust the LSTM forecast, typically through a weighted or scaled approach.

Here's how you can improve the combination of LSTM and GARCH models for forecasting VIX:

Use the LSTM model to predict the VIX levels.
Use the GARCH model to forecast the volatility of VIX log returns.
Adjust the LSTM forecast using the GARCH volatility forecast.
Step-by-Step Code for Improved Combination
1. Import Required Libraries
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from arch import arch_model
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
2. Load and Preprocess the Data
python
Copy code
# Load your data
# vix_data = pd.read_csv('vix_data.csv')  # Example data loading
vix_data = ...  # Load your VIX data here

# Ensure your data has a DateTime index
vix_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(vix_data['Date'])
vix_data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Preprocess the data
vix_data['log_return'] = np.log(vix_data['VIX'] / vix_data['VIX'].shift(1))
vix_data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Extract features and labels for LSTM
lstm_features = vix_data[['VIX']].values
lstm_labels = vix_data['VIX'].values
3. Build and Fit the LSTM Model
python
Copy code
# Create the LSTM model
lstm_model = Sequential()
lstm_model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(1, 1)))
lstm_model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=False))
lstm_model.add(Dense(1))

lstm_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Reshape the data for LSTM
lstm_features = lstm_features.reshape((lstm_features.shape[0], 1, 1))

# Fit the LSTM model
lstm_model.fit(lstm_features, lstm_labels, epochs=100, batch_size=32)
4. Generate LSTM Forecast
python
Copy code
# Forecast the next 62 days with LSTM
lstm_forecast = lstm_model.predict(lstm_features[-62:])
5. Fit the GARCH Model
python
Copy code
# Fit the GARCH model on the log returns
garch_model = arch_model(vix_data['log_return'], vol='Garch', p=1, q=1)
garch_fit = garch_model.fit(disp='off')

# Forecast the next 62 days with GARCH
garch_forecast = garch_fit.forecast(horizon=62)
garch_volatility = np.sqrt(garch_forecast.variance.values[-1])
6. Combine LSTM and GARCH Forecasts
Instead of simply adding, adjust the LSTM predictions using the GARCH forecasted volatility.

python
Copy code
# Scale LSTM predictions by GARCH volatility to adjust for predicted risk
# Assuming log return forecast for LSTM
lstm_forecast_adjusted = lstm_forecast.flatten() * np.exp(garch_volatility)

# Convert the log returns back to the VIX level
lstm_initial_value = vix_data['VIX'].values[-1]  # The last VIX value in the dataset
combined_forecast = [lstm_initial_value]

for i in range(len(lstm_forecast_adjusted)):
    combined_forecast.append(combined_forecast[-1] * lstm_forecast_adjusted[i])

combined_forecast = np.array(combined_forecast[1:])
7. Plot the Results
python
Copy code
# Plot the forecasted values
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(vix_data.index[-62:], vix_data['VIX'].values[-62:], label='Actual VIX')
plt.plot(pd.date_range(start=vix_data.index[-1], periods=63, closed='right'), combined_forecast, label='Combined Forecast')
plt.legend()
plt.title('VIX Forecast using LSTM and GARCH')
plt.show()
Explanation
LSTM Model: Predicts VIX levels based on past data.
GARCH Model: Forecasts future volatility based on past log returns.
Combination Strategy: Uses the GARCH volatility forecast to adjust the LSTM predictions, making them sensitive to the expected volatility. This adjustment scales the LSTM forecast based on the predicted volatility, potentially making the forecast more robust.
Key Points
Log Returns: Using log returns for GARCH is common because GARCH models volatility, which is more related to returns than to levels.
Scaling Factor: The exponential function 
exp
⁡
exp is used to revert the log return back to a multiplicative factor on the VIX level.
Last VIX Value: Starting from the last known VIX value, the combined forecast is iteratively calculated.
This approach aims to balance the direct level prediction from LSTM with the volatility adjustment from GARCH, potentially improving the robustness of the forecasts.
